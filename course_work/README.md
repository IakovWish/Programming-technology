You walk with crosses. Each move consists of three steps. You need to start from the upper left or lower right corner.
You can "eat" zeros. The server or the second player will eat crosses.

Eaten zeros form a blue chain. A chain can be "live" or "dead".
The cell next to which you can take a step contains a cross or an element of a living chain.

When starting the client, the user sees a playing field, status and menu in front of him.
The status prompts the user to select the start item from the menu. Other menu items (except for the exit from the application item - it is always available) are not available.
When you press the “Start” button, a data entry field appears in front of the player. Where the player must enter his data (login, password and preferences in the game), as well as the data of the server (address and port) to which he wants to connect.
If the user wants to play with the server, then in the “Pref” field, he must enter “server”.
If the user is not yet registered, then if the server allows registration of new users, he can come up with a login and password right here.
If “guest mode” is enabled, then the user can only use the “guest” login. The password will not be checked.

If it is impossible to connect to the server at the specified address and port, the program will display the appropriate window.

If the user incorrectly entered the login, password or registration is not allowed, then the corresponding window will be displayed.
If the user entered “server” in the “Pref” field, then the user will see an empty playing field, an inscription will appear at the bottom left, which means that the user’s turn is now, and he must make the first move. At the bottom right, a reminder is displayed that the game is happening with the server.

The user must select three cells where he will put his "viruses" according to the rules of the game. If it is impossible to resemble the selected cell, then the playing field does not change, and the inscription below will remind the player that it is now his turn. After the player has made his turn, the server will select three of his cells and make his move.

Further, the game will develop in accordance with the rules. During the game with the server, the user at any time has three saves with which he can move between games.
If the save does not exist, then the download button will be disabled. To save the game, you need to select the save in which the user wants to save in the “Server” menu and click the “Save” button. After a successful save, a window will appear informing the user about it and the “Download” button will become active for this save.
Once saved, the user can always navigate to that save. To do this, he must select the required save from the “server” menu and select the “Download” item. After that, a message will appear on the screen about the successful loading of the save, and the saved game will load.
If the player wants to finish this game, then in the “Game” menu, he can select the “Leave” item. After that, he will be disconnected from the server, about which he will be informed by the corresponding window and will return to the “start” menu item is not available, since the game is already in progress.
If the player wants to exit the program, he can do this using the “Quit” button in the “Game” menu. After that, the program will close, disconnecting the user from the server.

If the user wants to play the game not with the server, but with another player, he needs to enter something else, instead of the word “server”.
The difference between the game with another player and the game with the server is that while waiting for the connection of the second player, the corresponding inscription appears at the bottom left. Also, the “server” button is not available while the user is playing with another player. The “Game” button is available to the user, he can leave the game at any time.
After the second player is found, his login will appear at the bottom right, and during his turn, the corresponding inscription will appear at the bottom left.
